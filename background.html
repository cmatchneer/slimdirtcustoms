<h2>The Legend of Slimdirt</h2>
</div>
<p>Join me stranger and let me tell you a tale of the legend of Slimdirt<br>
He was a man with a vast collection of figures ranging as far the eye could see.
One day he decided to make some minor changes to one of his figures. This was the 
spark that over time as he made more and more customizations to his vast collection
grew into a wild raging fire. He began making figures from scratch for fun and to
test his skills. Now his services are available to all who wish to have custom figures
made for their joy. <br>
If you wish to have me...I uh mean him make you a figure reach out he is more then
willing to listen to any and all who love figures </p>
